INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This game is based on the popular arcade Asteroids.
A lot of enhancements have been done, however. The most obvious one is the
graphic.
   All objects in the game except the missiles and the font have been
rendered on a 3D raytracing package using 32 colors.
   Your spaceship is fixed in the center of the screen and all the nasties
scrolls around it. This makes it more playable.
   This time not only rocks will attempt to your life, even exploding mines
and killer UFOs too.
   Developed on a standard A1200, works with all the Amiga computers,
(tested on A500+,A1200 and A4000).
   It seem that A4000 users have to disable "cache memory" before loading
the game, sorry.



CAUTION!
~~~~~~~~
   This program doesn't multitasks, so don't try it while using modems, for
example.
   I want al the avaiable speed for my games!
In the future I will try to make it works in a Intuition 256 colors screen
(originally the graphic had 256 colors!), enabling multitasking, and
parhaps, it still will be fast enough on a A4000.
So look out for BlitzeroidsAGA !



DISTRIBUTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Blitzeroids is being distributed as Freeware.  It may be freely
distributed to any bulletin board service, network, public domain
collection and obviously, the wonderful mag Amiga Format.
   I'm not asking for donations on this one, but feel free to drop me a
note on e-mail in FidoNet if you can.
   Note, however, that Blitzeroids is NOT public domain.  The author
retains all rights to the program.



INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Blitzeroids requires no special libraries or fonts or anything to run.
Simply drag the Blitzeroids icon to wherever you wish to install it.
   It may be run from a Shell, Workbench, or even your favorite dirutil.



THE GAME
~~~~~~~~
   The objective for each stage is to destroy anything there is on screen.
There are three kinds of situations, however.

METEORS  You have to clear out the zone from dangerous meteors.  Hit them a
         number of times and these will break in two smaller meteors, break
         them again in two even smaller meteors each...

MINES    These objects are amaller and slower than a mormal meteor, but
         when shooted a lot of times, a dangerous explosion spreads away,
         risking to hit and destroy your ship.

TRAP     In this stage you have to destroy a "flying saucer" ship type.
         This is very fast and shoots at you, too!

The various stages are a little mixed, so it's easy to find a couple of
mines in the meteors stage, or meteors in the trap one.

A bonus live every 10 completed stages.

To play you have to use the joystick:

LEFT     Rotates your ship counter-clockwise.
RIGHT    Rotates your ship clockwise.
UP       Thrusts forward your ship.
DOWN     Go in hyperspace for a few of seconds, if in real troubles!
         You don't know where your ship will appear, however...
FIRE     Shoots missiles where you are aiming.



BUGS NOT YET FIXED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - My games have no bugs at all! Or not?
   - If you want to Guru your machine, try to go faster than light with
     your ship. (i.e. keep pressing up jour joystick for a couple of
     minutes...)
