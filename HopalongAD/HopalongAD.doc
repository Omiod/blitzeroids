INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This program lets you view and generate the "Hopalong Fractals" series.
It works in a window on the Workbench screen, so the quality of the
pictures depends on the number of colours and the size of your Workbench
uses.
It works even on non-AGA machines, but if these are found, it uses the
extra capabilites avaiables.



FEATURES
~~~~~~~~
   - Written in Blitz Basic 2 
   - Generates pictures up to 256 color.
   - Should work on any Workbench and 680XX version.
   - Aspect ratio supported up to 640x512 screens.
   - Actually you can't input picture's parameters, can only be choosed
     randomly.



DISTRIBUTION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   HopalongAD is being distributed as Freeware.  It may be freely
distributed to any bulletin board service, network, or public domain
collection.
   I'm not asking for donations on this one, but feel free to drop me a
note (preferably e-mail) or something if you want.
   Note, however, that HopalongAD is NOT public domain.  The author
retains all rights to the program.



INSTALLATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   HopalongAD requires no special libraries or fonts or anything to run.
Simply drag the HopalongAD icon to wherever you wish to install it.  It may be
run from a Shell, Workbench, or even your favorite dirutil.



BUGS NOT YET FIXED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - I can't know if the screen is opened to 1280x512, Blitz reports only a
     poor (!) 640x512.  So the aspect ratio control works only with OCS
     screens.

   - If the system font isn't of the standard size, something could not
     work propely.  ;) I.e. the image could be written on the window
     dragbar.
